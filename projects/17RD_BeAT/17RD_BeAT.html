<h5>Quantifying and Optimizing the Benefits and Risks of Urban Cycling</h5>
<br />
<br />
<p>This PhD project was aimed at developing comprehensive methods for quantifying the benefits and risks of urban cycling, investigating the environmental exposures of cyclists and developing a tool for optimising the design of cycling infrastructure. 
A comprehensive framework was developed for quantifying the health, environmental and travel time impacts of cycling including physical activity, pollution inhalation, traffic collisions, noise, vehicle emissions and congestion. Using census data, this framework was applied to a case study of increasing cycling in Dublin. It was shown that, at a societal level, the total net health and environmental impacts of increased cycling in Dublin would be strongly positive. The expected benefits and risks experienced by an individual cyclist switching from driving to cycling were also quantified. It was shown that for some groups, in particular males aged 20-30, cycling can have negative expected net health impacts. This was the first study to investigate the variation in health impacts of cycling experienced by individuals of different ages, genders and travel distances.

        One particular health impact of cycling—in-travel pollutant inhalation—had been relatively poorly understood in terms of the factors affecting its variation. In order to investigate this further using an exposure study, a new environmental sensing node—the BEE node—was first designed, built and validated. Volunteer cyclists then cycled through Dublin while using the BEE node to collect data about the pollution and noise they were exposed to. Analysis of this data produced new insights such as the observation that while segregated cycle lanes decreased pollution exposures, roadside cycle lanes and bus lanes actually increased exposures.

        In order to enable predictions of the changes in cycling which would result from a given intervention, a cycling disutility function—the DOC function—was also developed and calibrated for the first time. A new method for calibrating a cycling disutility function was developed for this purpose since there were no suitable existing methods. The new method involves formulating the calibration problem as a Mathematical Programme with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC) and solving the MPEC using a descent-based method. Using the newly developed calibration method, the new function was calibrated and its accuracy was validated based on data from the Dublin network.

        The final contribution of this thesis is the development of a tool for systematically designing a cycle network in order to optimise the resulting net impacts to society. This Network Design Problem (NDP) has been formulated as an MPEC and a solution approach is presented which uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal solution. The problem formulation and solution algorithm have been tested using a numerical example and the GA algorithm has been shown to efficiently converge to a near-optimal solution for the cycle network design.
