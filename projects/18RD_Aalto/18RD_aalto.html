<h5>Increasing Efficiency in use of Institutional Resources Through Intelligent Sharing</h5>
<br>
<p>Institutional resources such as campus buildings tend to be underutilised and are often vacant or partially vacant for large portions of each day. This project investigates the potential for increasing the efficiency in the use of such resources by transitioning to a service oriented operating model. In this model, intelligent scheduling systems are used to efficiently share resources accross departments within the institution as well as with other institutions and local businesses. A case study based on the campus of Aalto university in Espoo, Finland is presented in this study.

        The usage of each room in each building over time was recorded during 1 year using a campus space reservation app. These data were used to analyze the baseline occupancy levels of each building, the weekly requirements of each teaching type for each department and the suitability of each room for each teaching type.
        A counterfactual scenario was then simulated whereby the campus was reorganised in a service model format. Each department had a hub building and all other rooms were available as needed to each department. It was found that a 50% higher student population could be supported in this scenario.
        Another scenario was simulated whereby the remaining unused capacity was made available for a local high school. It was found that the total teaching hours could be increaed by 64% reletive to baseline.
