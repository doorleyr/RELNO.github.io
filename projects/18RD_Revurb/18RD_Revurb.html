<h5>Urban Performance Analysis using Spatio-temporal Telecom Data</h5>

<p>A fundamental aspect of well performing cities is successful public spaces. For centuries, understanding these places has been limited to sporadic observations and laborious data collection. This study proposes a novel methodology to analyze citywide, discrete urban spaces using highly-accurate anonymized telecom data and machine learning algorithms. Through superposition of the inferred human dynamics onto various urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users.

        Geolocated telecom data, obtained in the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify ‘stay points’ - events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence and diversity. Multivariate linear regression models were then used in order to identify associations between the formation of these clusters and various discrete urban features. Some of the urban features which were found to be important were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a ‘reversed urbanism’ methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled as a foundational design tool.
